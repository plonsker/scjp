#2chpt Objectives

• Develop code that declares classes (including abstract
and all forms of nested classes), interfaces, and enums,
and includes the appropriate use of package and import
statements (including static imports).

• Develop code that declares an interface. Develop code
that implements or extends one or more interfaces.
Develop code that declares an abstract class. Develop
code that extends an abstract class.

• Develop code that declares, initializes, and uses primitives,
arrays, enums, and objects as static, instance, and
local variables. Also, use legal identifiers for variable
names.

• Develop code that declares both static and non - static
methods, and— if appropriate — use method names that
adhere to the JavaBeans naming standards. Also develop
code that declares and uses a variable - length argument
list.

• Given a code example, determine if a method is correctly
overriding or overloading another method, and identify
legal return values (including covariant returns), for the
method.

• Given a set of classes and superclasses, develop constructors
for one or more of the classes. Given a class declaration,
determine if a default constructor will be created,
and if so, determine the behavior of that constructor.
Given a nested or non - nested class listing, write code to
instantiate the class.
