#1chpt Objectives

• Given a code example and a scenario, write code
that uses the appropriate access modifiers, package
declarations, and import statements to interact with
(through access or inheritance) the code in the example.

• Given an example of a class and a command line, determine the expected runtime behavior.

• Determine the effect upon object references and primitive
values when they are passed into methods that perform
assignments or other modifying operations on the
parameters.

• Given a code example, recognize the point at which an
object becomes eligible for garbage collection, determine
what is and is not guaranteed by the garbage collection
system, and recognize the behaviors of the Object
.finalize() method.

• Given the fully - qualified name of a class that is deployed
inside and/or outside a JAR file, construct the appropriate
directory structure for that class. Given a code example
and a classpath, determine whether the classpath will
allow the code to compile successfully.

• Write code that correctly applies the appropriate
operators including assignment operators (limited to: =,
+=, - = ), arithmetic operators (limited to: +, - , *, /, %,
++, - - ), relational operators (limited to: < , < =, > , > =, ==,
!= ), the instanceof operator, logical operators (limited to:
 & , |, ^, !, & & , || ), and the conditional operator ( ? : ),
to produce a desired result. Write code that determines
the equality of two objects or two primitives.
